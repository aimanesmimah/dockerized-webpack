This containerization approach applies to front-end apps using `Webpack` as a bundling instrument. 
Either you're relying on a single page application library or you're doing it differently you can count on this 
solution to containerize your app while on development mode.

### Make it work

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudstrife9494/dockerized-webpack.git
$ cd dockerized-webpack
$ docker-compose up
$ docker-compose up -d # to run the container in the background and preventing logs
```
